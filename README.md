# LiveOL

LiveOL is an app that displays orienteering-results live.
You get the latest results on your phone or tablet with a convenient interface in multiple languages.
LiveOL integrates many Orienteering related services, like liveresultat.orientering.se and Eventor Sweden.

Our vision is to be the best orienteering platform for mobile devices.

# Project structure

The project resides mostly in 2 folders, App and Server. The other folders are used for the website and other
non-critical aspects of the application.
